# Description of the implementation
A modified version of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm provided by Udacity excerise is being adapted and modified.

The main modifications are to 
1. adapt the DDPG to work with Unity environment
2. to make the code run with more than 1 agent. 


# Learning Algorithm:

### The learning algorithm

### Hyperparameters:

### Model architectures:

The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.


# Plot of Rewards:

A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that either:

[version 1] the agent receives an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +30, or
[version 2] the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes, and over all 20 agents) of at least +30.
The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.
