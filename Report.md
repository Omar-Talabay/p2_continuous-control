description of the implementation

The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.



A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that either:

[version 1] the agent receives an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +30, or
[version 2] the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes, and over all 20 agents) of at least +30.
The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.




The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
